    <h1> Welcome family and friends!</h1>
    <p>We look forward to sharing our Wedding day with you. For those who are attending, this website will provide you with all of our wedding day information and helpful tips for those traveling to Poole from around the UK or from abroad. For those of you that are unable to make it to our wedding, we thought this website would be a great way for us to share all of our experiences with you. </p>  
	<p>We realise people will be coming from both near and far, and arriving and departing at different times, so we want to make it easy for everyone to access information about our wedding and the activities surrounding our big day. There are some suggestions for places to stay in the Bournemouth and Poole area if you wish to stay for a night or two and you'll also find travel information, and some interesting stories about us and the rest of the wedding party.</p>
	<p>We hope you find this to be a useful tool when planning your trip. We will add information as we think of it, or as people ask us, so check back nearer the time to see what's new.</p> 
	<p>If you have any questions or suggestions you can email <a href="mailto:darren@hickling.is">Darren</a> or <a href="mailto:laura@hickling.is">Laura</a> and we will try and answer all of your questions.</p>
