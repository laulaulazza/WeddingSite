    <h2>Thursday 13th September 2012, 12:00</h2>
    <p>Darren leaves work to get his hair cut. Laura offers to accompany him for the walk to Spitalfields, but Darren makes up a reason for her to stay put in the office</p>
    <h2>Thursday 13th September 2012, 13:00</h2>
    <p>Darren sends Laura a text message to say he has remembered that he left the airconditioning on in the flat, and doesn't want it to cost us a lot of money so he's gone back to switch it off</p>
    <h2>Thursday 13th September 2012, 14:00</h2>
    <p>Darren calls Laura and leaves a voicemail saying now he's home, he's decided to take the afternoon off, as he's feeling unwell.</p>
    <h2>Thursday 13th September 2012, 16:00</h2>
    <p>Laura sees Ash (who works with Darren) and asks if he's seen Darren. Ash tells Laura that he hasn't. Laura is confused and asks Ash whether Darren was in their Jam Session (geeky coding meeting thingy) and Ash tells her he wasn't and that he hasn't seen him since he left to have his hair cut. Laura panics.</p>
    <h2>Thursday 13th September 2012, 16:05</h2>
    <p>Laura calls Darren, who explains he has tried to leave messages. Laura is relieved but worried about Darren.</p>
    <h2>Thursday 13th September 2012, 17:30</h2>
    <p>Laura leaves the office. On her way home she receives the messages sent to her earlier by Darren.</p>
    <h2>Thursday 13th September 2012, 18:15</h2>
    <p>Laura opens the door to the flat she shares with Darren. She calls out to see if he's OK, and is surprised when he shouts back in a happy, healthy voice</p>
    <h2>Thursday 13th September 2012, 18:15:05</h2>
    <p>Laura notices there is a path of rose petals leading into the sitting room. She follows them with a skip</p>
    <h2>Thursday 13th September 2012, 18:15:10</h2>
    <p>Laura figures out what's going on</p> 
    <h2>Thursday 13th September 2012, 18:16</h2>
    <p>Darren explains that dinner is still to be prepared and cooked, as he spent the whole afternoon cleaning the flat and preparing the dining table, which he has set up next to the windows, with candles, and an ice bucket for the elderflower presse</p>
    <h2>Thursday 13th September 2012, 18:30 - 19:45</h2>
    <p>Laura and Darren prepare and tuck into a delicious pregnant-lady-friendly meal of Moose Shaped Bruschetta (a nod to a fantastic Thanksgiving weekend in Vermont), and Steak with Deadmau5 mash (which symbolised the music they listen to on their roadtrips, and the $65 pair of steaks bought by mistake from Wholefoods in Darien)</p>
    <h2>Thursday 13th September 2012, 19:45</h2>
    <p>Darren gives Laura a card. The letter he's written makes her start to cry (in a happy way) until she gets to the part that says "Would you... find our new friend, he's with the cat"</p>
    <h2>Thursday 13th September 2012, 19:46</h2>
    <p>Laura is confused as she and Darren do not own a cat. Darren finds this amusing. Laura goes looking for "the cat"</p>
    <h2>Thursday 13th September 2012, 19:47</h2>
    <p>Laura realises that "the cat" is in fact "Mahmoud the Tatty Cat", our "decorative" cat brought back from our holiday in Sharm el Sheikh.</p>
    <h2>Thursday 13th September 2012, 19:48</h2>
    <p>Laura finds their "new friend" hanging on Tatty Cat, who has been behind her the whole time they have been eating. "Ring Buddy" is holding something very shiny!</p>
    <h2>Thursday 13th September 2012, 19:48:30</h2>
    <p>Darren gets down on one knee and pops the question</p>
    <h2>Thursday 13th September 2012, 19:48:45</h2>
    <p>Laura tells Darren "Yes please, that would be super-fly-awesome!"</p>
